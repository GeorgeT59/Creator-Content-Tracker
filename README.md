# About Creator Content Tracker:
Allows the user to track the URLs within the JSON file.

I got tired of keeping track of various artists and creators on different websties, so I made a program in Python/Tkinter that allows the user to keep track of various artists/creators from different websites in the test.json file.

# Note:
I only tested this on a Mac OS (So I can't say how it'll be on Windows or other OS).

# How to use:
Change the JSON file called test.json in the JSON folder to whichever URLs you wish to track.

# About the JSON file:

name = The name of the website.

creator = Name of the creator.

website = URL [Most important field, naming this something else won't work.]

date_clicked: Last date it was clicked using this app.

If you know JSON, you can add more objects (name, creator, and website fields)

date_created 'should' be created automatically.
