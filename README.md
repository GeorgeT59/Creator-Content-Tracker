# About Creator Content Tracker:
Allows the user to track the URLs within the JSON file.

I got tired of keeping track of various artists and creators on different websties, so I made a program in Python/Tkinter that allows the user to keep track of various artists/creators from different websites in the test.json file.

# Note:
I tested this on Mac and PC. (Not sure about other OS)

# How to use:
Change the JSON file called test.json in the JSON folder to whichever URLs you wish to track.

Then open Python IDLE and select Run. The program should look like this when opened:

# About the JSON file:

name = The name of the website.

creator = Name of the creator.

website = URL [Most important field, naming this something else won't work.]

date_clicked: Last date it was clicked using this app.

If you know JSON, you can add more objects (name, creator, and website fields)

date_created 'should' be created automatically upon clicking/opening the URL.
