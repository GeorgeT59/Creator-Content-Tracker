# About Creator Content Tracker:
Allows the user to track the URLs within the JSON file.

I got tired of keeping track of various artists and creators on different websties, so I made a program in Python/Tkinter that allows the user to keep track of various artists/creators from different websites in the test.json file.

# Note:
I only tested this on a Mac OS (So I can't say how it'll be on Windows or other OS).

# How to use:
Change the JSON file called test.json in the JSON folder to whichever URLs you wish to track.
